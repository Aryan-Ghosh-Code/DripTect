# DripTect
DripTect is an integrated flood monitoring system that combines sensor-based hardware (Arduino/ESP32), and machine learning (Random Forest) to provide real-time flood detection, classification, and alerting. A centralized web dashboard allows users to monitor region-specific data, view risk levels, and receive alerts.
